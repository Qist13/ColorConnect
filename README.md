# ColorConnect

ColorConnect is a tile-matching game where the objective of the game is to match/align as many 'circles' of the same color 
as possible in a row or column with longer matches awarding more points to the player (each match must be atleast of length 3).

This project was completed along with a tutorial during my time in high school for my computer science class.
